# Betting Market Analysis Platform

Betting Market Analysis Platform is a project I did for my Engineering Thesis. It perform simple ETL process on data about football matches, using Python, which then are visualized in Power BI. The reports show the informations such as:
- Performance of selected football teams
- Most favored football teams by betting companies


## Usage

### Python script that executes ETL process
To execute the ETL process of this project, just run `main.py`:
```console
foo@bar:~$ python main.py
```
> [!WARNING]
> Make sure the `config.yaml` file is in the same directory as `main.py`. The script requires this file to function properly.
